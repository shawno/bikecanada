My leg started feeling a little better after 150 km or so. Not the best rehab I'm sure, but we had a monster ~30km/h tail wind that we couldn't squander. Tomorrow will be a short one into Winnipeg, where I plan to get a massage.

Finally, we collectively slaughtered the elephant that had infiltrated our group over the last few weeks: we each had very different expectations about how this trip would go. These fall generally into two categories: 

1. Ride monster days, live frugally, and push our physical limits.
2. Ride conservative distances, soak up the small towns, and unwind at a slower pace.

Both are completely legit strategies for such an adventure, but the compromise between them lends itself to no one getting what they really want out of the summer, and everyone feeling like the trip was ""just ok"". For this reason we have decided to split off into two pairs: Paul and Rich are after the first adventure discussed above, and Simon and I are going for the second.

This is definitely a bittersweet decision, but I think we all feel quite relieved to get all the cards on the table and focus on why we are each here in the first place. We each wish the others the best tour possible, so there are absolutely zero hard feelings, and a little sadness that the hilarity and inside jokes will now diverge.

It would also have been useless to have this conversation any earlier, as we all wanted to get the prairies over with since there's not much to see, and it's very advantageous to have a larger group when fighting the wind. Tomorrow we'll hit Winnipeg, which feels like the last major prairie milestone, so we'll stock up, make sure each pair has everything they need, and continue our adventures separately. 

The first leg was insane and hilarious and amazing. The next will be even better.

By noonish we were in Winnipeg, with Paul's rear wheel acting up again. This led us to a great little hole in the wall bike shop which rebuilt the wheel with a new rim, guaranteeing that not a single spoke would break for the rest of the trip. That's confidence in your work!

My cousin Sarah greeted us at my uncle's house in the North West part of the city, and was surprised at how eager we were to literally hose ourselves off outside before showering. A hose is one of my new favourite things. This trip has definitely readjusted my standards for things like ""clean water"".  One campsite insisted that they had high iron, but it really looked like mud. If it's brown, chug it down. Another time we sprayed ourselves down behind a gas station. If you are too proud for that, do not attempt to cycle across the prairies in the summer. Sometimes you just need to cool down for safety.

We ended up splurging for a motel last night after getting totally drenched and freezing on the ride. As Simon put it, ""objectively speaking this is disgusting, but subjectively it is a palace"". By any measure, it was a piece of crap motel. The only saving grace was the lack of bed bugs. We were also blown away by the ability to simply get out of bed, pee, and get back in bed - something you take for granted when the new normal goes something like this: 
- wake up
- pretend you don't have to pee
- get really annoyed that you actually do
- decide peeing in your sleeping bag would be catastrophic
- get dressed
- squeeze out of the tent while attempting to let zero mosquitoes inside
- fail at keeping mosquitoes out
- pee while swatting mosquitoes
- get bitten three times anyway
- finish peeing
- sprint away from your tent to fake out the mosquito cloud that has formed
- cut hard back toward your tent while brushing your arms all over your body to get the clingers off
- dive back into your tent
- commence the mosquito genocide inside the tent
- sweat a lot
- get undressed once all bogies have been eliminated 
- go back to sleep

So a bathroom is nice, and a bed.

Anyway, today was fun. The 10 solid hours of sleep definitely helped morale, and the fact that although it oscillated between 10 and 30 degrees all day, as we climbed 1000m, with a headwind, we didn't get rained on. We also met some really cool folks.

One couple is circumnavigating Lake Superior on their summer off from university, and were real friendly.

Another guy named Jean-Yves is WALKING from Trois Rivieres, Quebec, to Vancouver, BC. He expects it to take until sometime late this fall. He is a retired chemical engineer, very down to earth, and shockingly normal for someone taking on such a seemingly insane trip. Paul and a rich ran into him a few days ago, and he remembered them, it was very cool to chat with him on the side of the highway for 15 minutes or so. His pace of around 30 km per day makes our 28 day distance feel like a drop in the bucket. Today was filled with great people. In general the highlight of the trip so far has been the overwhelming positivity of the folks we meet along the way. It makes me proud to be Canadian.

When there's room to ride your mind can wander to bigger life issues and solve problems that are lingering in the back of your mind. On days like today there's no time for that.

Neither is a great.

At one point I started laughing out loud. Every day previously I had been coping mentally with phrases like ""at least it's not also raining"", ""at least it's not a gravel road"", etc. after the third section of resurfacing  grooves covered in a centimetre of water, I began to realize that Ontario was taking my positive thinking as a dare, and that the next day would indeed be that.

We mostly tuned bikes, ate, and stretched, but I also got a swim in and a great call with Emily while I lay in the shade on the dock. It's great to take a day to break up the routine. It was our first since Winnipeg, and around 1800km.

Speaking of routine, one theme that keeps popping into my head, and has come up in a few conversations is how there's both too much and too little routine.

Every day is too much the same, and every day is too different.

The same:
- wake up in a tent
- put in a cycling kit
- pack up sleeping bag and anything in the tent
- try to remember which town I'm in
- get out and start eating breakfast while packing the bike
- ride all day, as long as one would normally spend at work
- stuff my face as much as possible on the bike
- stop riding at a campground
- shower, set up tent, make dinner, eat dinner, dishes, laundry, phone calls, blog posts, bike maintenance, hydrate, hang food, etc etc
- attempt to finish all this and get in the tent before the sun is down or the mosquito cloud will devour you.

Different: nothing is static, every day it's new town and a new grocery store to navigate and a new set of insects to deal with and no stability.

So it's a strange duality of routine and chaos. The rest days help mellow out both.

This morning we crossed into Quebec right away, since Ottawa touches it. As soon as we were on the north side of the river we jumped on the Route Verte we had heard so much about, which is a cycling network all the way across Quebec. It's a world of difference from riding the 17. I'm so glad to be finished Longtario. That felt like it was never going to end, and definitely had some low lows.

The higher density of towns, and relatively short day, meant we had time to stop for brunch, then coffee, then lunch. That's not necessarily a pattern I'd like to entrench, but with this evening's destination being relatively remote, we thought it'd be a good opportunity to slow roll and practice some French.

We had set up our tents just in time before a huge downpour started, so most everything stayed dry, but Eby, our host, then offered that we move into the huge greenhouse, since there is a heavy thunderstorm warning tonight, with potential hail up to the size of a nickel. We took her up on it. So now I'm on the floor of the greenhouse, in my tent so the flies don't devour me, while two barn cats are poking at the side of my tent, trying to get in to snuggle.

The density of the towns along both shores of the Saint Laurence means that the kilometres just roll by, sometimes clocking 20k or more between looking at my bike computer at all.

figure that out. I thought of it today because I realized how relaxing it was to not have to stare at the pavement literally all day long.

So there are a lot of towns here. And each has ""Saint"" in the name, as my mother pointed out. Each also has a massive church. They take their worship seriously around here. They're nearly always the nicest building in the town, by far.

I really enjoyed the last few days, as I had expected I would before even starting the trip. Though we are still in Quebec, I found myself reflecting on the time here over the last week. Some things that stood out include:

- My French has improved considerably. I now have complete conversations with people daily. It's nice to use it again.
- It's easy to build nice bike infrastructure on a municipal scale, and many cities in other provinces do that well, but to connect it all together at a provincial level is a much bigger undertaking, and Quebec has nailed it.
- If you provide infrastructure, your citizens will take advantage of it. We saw dozens of tourists of all ages, riding from town to town. None were surprised to see us. Most were very surprised that we had come from so far. This tells me that Qu√©b√©cois folks generally do a lot of bike touring close to home. Imagine Newfie retirees riding 60km for a half dozen days in a row. There are zero, but that's how it works here.
- The Saint Laurence is so relaxing. It reminds me of the pace of life on the islands off the coast of BC; no one is in a hurry. Probably because so many folks are retirees or on vacation.
- I want to see the rest of the Gaspe Peninsula some day. Leaving it feels premature, but I'm glad to have seen as much as we did.

Every time we cross a border, the license plates on the cars immediately all switch to the new province, as if they're unable to cross the imaginary lines we as a country have created. It's even noticeable in neighbouring cities that are divided by no more than a river; people stay to their side for the most part. 

My own life seems to reflect this, generally (this trip being an exception). I would wager that >99% of my time is spent inside a geographic area with a 5km radius. Mom used to always say most accidents happen close to one's home as a way to get me to wear a bike helmet or seat belt, even if it was just around the block. If that stat is true, it's clearly because most life happens there.

It's nice to get out of that bubble. It helps us see that our home town isn't the only one with a ""Water street"", and that any other one you see isn't named after the one you happened to be born closest to. It's a good reminder of our individual insignificance, and perceived self importance. Tangent: everyone thinks their town has ""the craaaaziest hill omg you'll never get up it on that bike!""

Just before lunch we reached Kelly's Mountain, which was underwhelming from a ""mountain"" perspective, but a great little climb and descent, with huge viewpoints on both the north and south sides. There were hundreds of purple daisies growing along the side of the road over the top of hill, the first I had noticed over the whole trip. They've got a good view up there.

We were told there was a shower in the ferry terminal, but there was not. We got creative. The cleaning crew were not impressed. Serves you right Marine Atlantic.

Now we're sitting in the terminal, killing time. We planned out a potential timeline through Newfoundland. 10 days left.",23010,94.99,activities/420818569.fit.gz,77,44,23010,14983,94993.29688,14.19999981,790,,-79.19999695,229.6000061,17.10000038,-0.076005399,145.2510071,2426.569824,27

This meant we were all grins for the first half hour or so, despite the rain, drizzle, and fog (RDF) the island is so known for.

Once all the big welcome signs were behind us and we started to settle in for the day, the size of the remaining task at hand started to creep into my mind: we still have about 1000km left to cycle. Before I had too much time to ponder this fact, the fog started to break up near the Twin Hills, and we could catch a glimpse of blue sky for the first time. Riding between the hills and toward the western side of the range produced some of the most incredible views on the trip so far. The fog was pouring over the tops of the hills, but burning off almost immediately upon hitting the warm air on the other side. This was on our right for about an hour, with the ocean on our left. Why doesn't anyone live out here? It's known as the Wreckhouse area, for the high winds, but we can make buildings to tolerate much more intense wind than we could 100 years ago. Concrete and steel exist now. In earthquake zones.

Once the novelty wore off, and we had ridden beyond the fog bank anyway, I had time to remember that we were not yet, in fact, finished the bike trip, and still had to ride for over a week. I had a good few hours to stew in that headspace, which was pretty ugly. In retrospect, I think riding in the other direction, to finish in BC, might be more enjoyable for me. In this direction I'm riding away from the life I have chosen and created and love, and toward the one I wanted to leave. It's a little less exciting.

That said, I am very excited to see everyone at the end, and on the way through the province. There are a lot of people here who mean a lot to me, so for that reason I'll suck it up and ride this huge barren wasteland.

Tonight we're in Barachois Pond Provincial Park, about 75km south-west of Corner Brook. I had heard of the park before, but this is my first time here. I expect a lot of stops along the way will share that same theme as the trip comes to a close. Life touring on a bike definitely flows at slower pace.

After we set up out tents and covered our panniers, we went to get some lunch/dinner, and it poured while we were eating. Luckily the stuff inside the tents stayed more or less dry, but my pannier covers seem to be completely useless now, holding in more water than they keep out. 

Some other gear is definitely on its last legs, including my flip flops, which have both undergone surgery at the hands of yours truly, and my red bibshorts, which have little elastic spaghetti peeling off the compression band. My pillow also has a slow leak. Hang in there gear, one week left! It's funny how in 10 weeks we're putting in a full lifetime worth of use on some equipment. When you think of a friend who ""does a lot of camping"", they may use their tent a half dozen times a year. That'd be a decent season. We're doing that in a week, and it's frequently packed away wet. Put that way, 70 days is a decade worth of use, which seems like a respectable lifetime for a piece of equipment. Anything that makes it until the very end with remaining useful life will get my seal of approval.

Speaking of one week left... ONE freakin week left!! I'm interested to see how my brain handles not cycling for 4 to 8 hours every day. I wonder if days will feel really long or really short.

Last night we got rained out pretty bad, and started the day with a soggy everything, on 15km of dirt road, uphill. Morale boost right there. Google had suggested we take a highway that was more like a really bad FSR, or a really good pole line. The locals had said ""bys got she all fixed up fer da loggin trucks, so ye'll be beskind on dem pedal-bikes."" We were not best kind, ordinary kind at best.

We finally escaped the insanity after 15km in 1.5 hours or so. I say insanity, but if I hadn't been so stressed about punctures, or broken spokes, or broken rack welds, or any of the other 1000 things that could go wrong, it would have been a super fun rip through the woods.

We set out for Grand Falls originally, but ended up riding more, and stopping more than planned, but all for good reasons.

First we had lunch in Badger with Brad, Ariel, Kajsa and Alex, on their way west across the island to spend a few days in Gros Morne. We had initially kept a spare day in our back pocket to potentially do a trip up that way, but most of the scenery we would want to experience would require either a hike or a boat ride, while the riding would be much of the same as the rest of the west coast of the island. Instead we'll keep that spare day for chillin in Gander.

After lunch we came across Paul and his girlfriend on their way east across the island, after he competed in a cycling race over the weekend. They had a ton of snacks for us, and it was sweet to catch up, though too short. We'll get plenty more chance in Gander.

Finally, we had made good time and felt pretty good, so me made a dent in tomorrow's ride by passing through Grand Falls to spend the night in Bishop's Falls.

If you're reading this and debating riding across Canada, first, stop it. It's not going to be as fun as you're expecting. Second, don't bother riding across Newfoundland. Vancouver to Halifax is just fine. If you must, take the Argentia ferry and skip most of NL. Spend those days in the Yukon, or PEI, or nearly anywhere else except northern Ontario.
